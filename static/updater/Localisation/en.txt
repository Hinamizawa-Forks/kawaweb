EditorTip_1=Press 'H' to bring up the quick-reference shortcuts list!
EditorTip_2=Press 'V' to quickly jump to the last hit-circle.  Press it again to jump to the end of the audio.
EditorTip_3=Timing is very important; a wrongly timed beatmap makes it very difficult to place beats correctly and is frustrating to play. If you need timing assistance, submit your beatmap to the Beatmap Help forum or ask for a timing check in #modreqs.
EditorTip_4=Distance Snapping can help you determine beat spacing, i.e. the correct distance between beats based on how far apart they are on the timeline.
EditorTip_5=Use spinners sparingly! Autoplay must be able to obtain at least 1000 bonus score for the spinner to be considered playable.
EditorTip_6=If you need additional help, don't shout HEEEAAALP! or OUENDAAAN! Try reading the site's wiki, asking a question on #modhelp or posting on the Beatmap Help forum.
EditorTip_7=Generally speaking, the harder the beatmap, the longer combos tend to be, but don't make them too long! Up to 15-18 beats are acceptable.
EditorTip_8=Beats placed on top of each other will be stacked in play mode.  To see how stacks look during the play, select View → Stacking.
EditorTip_9=If you place a beat after a spinner, try to put it far enough in the timeline so that the player has enough time to readjust their aim.
EditorTip_10=Using AiMod (Ctrl-Shift-A) is a fantastic way to identify potential issues with your map long before the first modder ever checks it out.
EditorTip_11=You can use Copy (Ctrl+C) and Paste (Ctrl+V) to repeat beat patterns in your beatmap. Try to mix things up by flipping them horizontally (Ctrl+H), vertically (Ctrl+J), or rotating them (Ctrl+> and Ctrl+<).
EditorTip_12=Spice your beatmap up by using Whistle, Finish and Clap sounds to punctuate certain points! However, overusing these sounds may have the opposite effect.
EditorTip_13=Try to put some breaks in your beatmap to allow players a moment's rest! Ideally, breaks should be between 5-15 seconds and occur every 40 seconds to 1 minute of play time, but this can vary depending on the song.
EditorTip_14=If you want to make a more difficult version of a beatmap, try adding more beats where possible, use less or faster sliders, make combos longer, and change the difficulty settings at the Song Setup screen.
EditorTip_15=If you want to make an easier version of a beatmap, try adapting the core rhythm and flow of your original beatmap whilst tweaking your beatmap's difficulty settings through Song Setup.
EditorTip_16=Try arranging beats and sliders in patterns of lines, curves or angles to make your beatmap more intuitive to play and nice to watch. Grid Snapping may help you with this.
EditorTip_17=Test your beatmap often to identify potential problems and improvements.
EditorTip_18=Use the speed buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the Editor (or press the (Ctrl+) Up and Down arrow keys) to slow the song down and determine the offset, timing, and make beat placement easier.
EditorTip_19=If you have placed some beats and then change the timing settings, don't forget to resnap the beats and recalc the sliders from the Timing menu, then manually snap any beats that are still misplaced.
EditorTip_20=In some songs, the tempo can change in certain places. In this case, you should use the Timing panel to make additional timing sections with the offset being the point where the song's tempo changes.
EditorTip_21=Bookmarks can help you and others move quickly to important points in your beatmap. Hover your mouse over the seek bar at the bottom of the editor screen to display the Bookmark buttons.
EditorTip_22=When placing a slider, click often along its path to create waypoints that you can adjust to make it smoother. You can add a waypoint after placing a slider by holding Ctrl and clicking on the line between two waypoints. Right clicking on a waypoint will remove it.
EditorTip_23=Extra-lengthy spinners are tiring, while short spinners are disorienting. Try to keep your spinners a few seconds long, and avoid placing a lot of spinners one after the other.
EditorTip_24=Right-clicking on objects on the beatmap or the timeline will remove them. Right-clicking on an empty spot will make the next beat or any selected beats the start of a new combo.
EditorTip_25=Place bookmarks at important points in your beatmap, such as at the start of a change in timing, after a break, or at the start of song's verse, chorus or bridge.
EditorTip_26=Use the J/K keys to shift selected beats backward/forward by one timing division.
EditorTip_27=Press F5 or click the "test" button at the bottom of the screen to test a beatmap from the section you are at. This can help identify problems with health drain and placement of beats. It can also help you practice a particular section of a song.
EditorTip_28=Zoom in on the timeline by hovering your mouse over the timeline and holding Alt while scrolling with the mousewheel. You can also press the +/- buttons to the left of the timeline. This can help clarify the timing of beats in the timeline.
EditorTip_29=If double/triple checking your timings or beat placements, use the audio speed (25%, 50%) in the lower-right corner in the editor. Shortcut keys are Up/Down arrows or Ctrl+Up/Down arrows.
EditorTip_30=If you decide to abandon a beatmap, no worries. Abandoned beatmaps are automatically graveyarded after a period of inactivity - if you wish to revive your map, simply click Resurrect next to the map on your profile.
EditorTip_31=Any element of gameplay can be skinned on a per-beatmap level.  Just use the same naming structure used by skins.
